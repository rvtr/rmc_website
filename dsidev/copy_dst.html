<b>Repaire Tool RESTORE</b> is used to restore the NAND from SD backups made by <a href="/dsidev/copy_org.html">Repaire Tool BACKUP</a>. RESTORE was used for repairs in Nintendo's repair facilities, and was not a proof of concept like other TwlIPL tests.
<br><br>
The restore process is as follows:
<ul>
<li>Restore RTC and HWInfo</li>
<li>Restore the WiFi board firmware</li>
<li>Restore user settings</li>
<li>Restore <code>nand:/shared2/</code></li>
<li>Restore photos</li>
<li>Restore installed titles</li>
<li>Set up shop config</li>
<li>Restore saves</li>
</ul>
