<h1 align="left">PhotoChecker</h1>


<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
<code>PhotoChecker</code> is a TWL application that checks the photo region in the TWL system.<br>Using this tool, you can check whether any illegal files exist that were not written via the TCL library.
</p>


<h2>Execution</h2>
<h3></h3>
<p>
Run it in one of the following ways.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the IS-TWL-DEBUGGER software to run <code>PhotoChecker.srl</code>
</li><li>Write <code>PhotoChecker.srl</code> to a TWL Game Card and then run it
</li></ul>
<p>
When it runs, the images that exist in and below <code>photo:</code> appear on the upper screen, and the filenames appear one after the other on the lower screen. If any item in or under <code>photo:</code> is in an illegal state, the upper screen turns red. If everything is in normal state, the upper screen turns green. <br>The following are considered illegal states.
</p>
<ul>
<li>When the management file does not exist (perhaps because the 
Nintendo DSi Cameras have never been activated) but the other files 
exist
</li><li>When the management file is invalid
</li><li>When the written file existed without going through the Nintendo DSi Camera and TCL
</li><li>When the file written via the Nintendo DSi Camera and TCL was deleted without going through the Nintendo DSi Camera
</li></ul>
<p>
Specifically, the following error messages are displayed.<br> <br>
