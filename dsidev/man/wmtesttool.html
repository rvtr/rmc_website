<h2>Overview</h2>
<code>WMTestTool</code> is a program made to test the TWL and DS 
wireless features. When the program is started, the MAC address is 
displayed in the lower portion of the screen. The MAC address is the 
value obtained with <a href="file:///Users/lillianskinner/Downloads/twlsetup/TwlSDK/TwlSDK/man/en_US/os/ownerInfo/OS_GetMacAddress.html"><code>OS_GetMacAddress</code></a>. The following four items will be displayed on the main menu:
<table border="1" width="100%">

<h2>Scan Test</h2>
Select items by pressing Up and Down on the +Control Pad. Pressing Left 
and Right on the +Control Pad will change the parameters. Start the scan
 by pressing the A Button, and end it with the B Button.
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
	<tr>
<td width="200"><b>Channel</b></td>
      <td width="800">
		When set to seek, this scans through channels 1, 7, and 13. <br> When a value between 1 and 13 is designated, only that channel will be searched. <br> However, even in that case the parent devices on a number of neighboring channels may be found.
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
<td width="200"><b>MaxChannelTime</b></td>
      <td width="800">
		Maximum amount of time to search on a single channel. <br> This time can be configured in the range of 10-300 milliseconds.
	  </td>
	</tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>ScanEx Test</h2>
Select items by pressing Up and Down on the +Control Pad. Pressing Left 
and Right on the +Control Pad will change the parameters. Start ScanEx 
by pressing the A Button, and end it with the B Button.
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
	<tr>
<td width="200"><b>Channel</b></td>
      <td width="800">

      <td width="800">
		Maximum amount of time to search on a single channel. <br> This time can be configured in the range of 10-300 milliseconds. <br> When the ScanType is Active, this value is fixed at 50 milliseconds.

<h2>MeasureChannel Test</h2>
Select items by pressing Up and Down on the +Control Pad. Pressing Left 
and Right on the +Control Pad will change the parameters. Start 
MeasureChannel with the A Button, and end it with the B Button.
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
	<tr>
<td width="200"><b>Channel</b></td>
      <td width="800">

<td width="200"><b>MeasureTime</b></td>

		Configures the scan time (in milliseconds). <br> A value of 10-1000 in increments of 10 can be configured.
	  </td>
	</tr>

<h2>Noise Mode</h2>
Select items by pressing Up and Down on the +Control Pad. Pressing Left 
and Right on the +Control Pad will change the parameters. Start noise 
generation with the A Button, and end it with the B Button. Once noise 
generation has started, the number of times noise is generated or not 
generated will be displayed.
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
	<tr>
<td width="200"><b>Channel</b></td>
      <td width="800">
		Configures the channel that generates the noise. <br> A value of 1-13 can be configured here. <br> Keep in mind that this will influence a number of neighboring channels.
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
<td width="200"><b>Noise rate</b></td>
      <td width="800">
		Configures the noise generation rate. <br> Noise generation or non-generation is determined randomly for each frequency interval. <br> Make sure that this rate is the amount of time that the radio waves are being emitted rather than the strength of those waves. <br>
 Changes can be made even after noise generation starts. Note that a 
noise rate of 100 percent is an extreme case and this state is not 
sustainable in a real environment.
	  </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
<td width="200"><b>Frequency</b></td>
      <td width="800">
		Cycle (in milliseconds) that determines whether noise is generated or not generated. A value from 5-50 can be configured here.
