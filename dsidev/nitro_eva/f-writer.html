F-WRITER is the <b>F</b>irmware <b>writer</b> for the DS. Each version contains a single copy of the firmware in <code>nitro:/Ipl2/link/</code>. This firmware has a FF filled header, and no config region. Strings in copies of F-WRITER have been found to list undumped and unknown firmware versions.

Unlike the other Nitro EVAs, F-WRITER is in its own special category. The bundled tests are exclusive to F-WRITER, and it does not contain any of the standard tests.
