<p>Mic Tester (also known as <b>MIC</b>) is a version of Nitro EVA used to test the DS microphone and speakers. There are two known versions of Mic Tester.</p>
<h3>2007/05/07 (v4):</h3>
<p>
This comes with 4 major tests, as well as some of the usual Nitro EVA tests:
</p>
<ul>
        <li><code>SOUND</code>, Plays some simple sound effects and music to test the speakers</li>
        <li><code>MIC</code>, A few microphone tests. One is the <code>SAMPLING DATA GRAPH</code>, which displays a real time graph of the mic input.</li>
        <li><code>MIC CHECKER</code>, Appears to be another microphone test, though it's impossible to use as it requires special factory hardware</li>
        <li><code>SPEAKER TESTER</code>, Plays a tone in the left and right speakers to make sure they're working</li>
</ul>

<h3>2008/12/01:</h3>
<p>This later version has had nearly  feature stripped, with the exception of <code>SPEAKER TESTER</code>. The Nitro EVA menu is not accessible, and none the tests mentioned above are included.</p>
