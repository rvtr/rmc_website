<p>
The Nitro EVA prototype is from just over 5 months before the release of the Nintendo DS. The prototype is very unique compared to other Nitro EVAs, containing more rubust debugging features such as EEPROM, FLASH, FRAM, and SPI tests + memory viewers. Many tests were over-engineered for what they are, such as touch screen tests using a small drawing utility with multiple pens colors and sizes. Though despite fun extras, the prototype is still very limited. The only factory tests available are AGING, FLICKER, and LCD, and the graphics tests are not accessible individually.

The prototype doesn't seem to have been designed for a factory as it isn't streamlined like would be expected for repetitive testing. Since the prototype was shipped on a long boi prototype cartridge (pictured below), it was probably targeted towards developers who had access to early development hardware, ensuring that prototype models had no faults.

<p>
The PSRAM test (dated 2004/03/16) is still called "IRIS PSRAM Check", suggesting that Nitro EVA is a continuation of IRIS test software. While IRIS was cancelled, the last updates to the <a href="https://twlsdk.randommeaninglesscharacters.com/download/irisSDK/" target="_blank">IrisSDK</a> were on 2004/01/20, so the Nitro EVA prototype is still closely related.
