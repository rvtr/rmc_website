    <h1>3DS factory tools and SDs</h1>
    <p>Thanks to March42 we just got 6 new TWL EVA dumps (3 working, 3 unbootable)! These cartridges would have been used for factory setup and testing of DSis. 

    <h2 id="write_sdmc">BSL_W</h2>
    BSL_W is a tool to test/setup the 3DS wifi, and a part of the IMPORT process. The tool starts by connecting the 3DS to a factory router, 



- Seems to work with the IMPORT program
- BSL_W starts with some wifi thing, then IMPORT continues



- 3DS: Hello PC!
- PC: Hi! Can I please have some datas?

    <p><b>BSL_W</b> is a tool to install the <a href="/dsidev/sdmc_launcher.html">SDMC Launcher</a> bootloader. It's difficult to say exactly what the purpose was, but WRITE SDMC-LNC is most likely for repairs. For example, a factory worker might install the wrong firmware to a DSi, so it must be reset. Installing SDMC Launcher would allow the worker to run <a href="/dsidev/twl_eva_pre_import.html">PRE_IMPORT</a> and return the DSi to a blank state. WRITE SDMC-LNC does not seem to be a part of the normal factory process.<br><br>This tool explains one of our older releases, the <a href="/dsidev/release/sdmc-launcher.html">SDMC Launcher DSi</a>. That DSi presumably returned to the factory for repairs and had the SDMC Launcher installed, showing that WRITE SDMC-LNC was actually used.</p>

    <h2 id="write_sdmc">CTR Camera Sequencer Program</h2>
    <p><b>CTR Camera Sequencer Program</b> is a tool used to test the 3DS cameras. A 3DS is connected to the Sequencer software by a cartridge's "HDMI" port, and is placed in a dark box. The 3DS is shown various images and Sequencer displays the camera output on the PC. The images shown are diagnostics like color charts.</p>
