This is a special <a href="https://dsibrew.org/wiki/Stage2" target="_blank">stage2</a> bootloader that boots an SRL off of the SD card. Only used in factories, this bootloader is installed on every DSi when it enters the <a href="/dsidev/twlboardchecker.html">BOARD</a> phase of testing. This allows the DSi to run tools like <a href="/dsidev/twl_eva_pre_import.html">PRE_IMPORT</a> that will install an actual firmware. SDMC Launcher is found in most copies of TWL EVA and is treated as a fallback bootloader in case certain NAND writing operations fail. <br><br>Both the dev and prod versions are interchangable and will boot on either type of DSi. Normally stage2s will not boot at all if the signing is mixed, resulting in a stage1 error. However, SDMC Launcher's code checks the SCFG_OP register to make sure that the DSi signing matches SDMC Launcher's, so the stage2 will boot but immediately crash.
<br>
SRLs must be signed for the target console in order to be run.
