This is most likely a test to see if HWInfo and the final firmware can be written or not. <b>PREWRITE</b> creates and signs HWInfo just like <a href="/dsidev/twl_eva_prepare.html">PREPARE</a> does, though PREWRITE seems to have extra steps such as backing up/restoring logs during formatting. PREWRITE writes the following log entry which is not found in any DSi logs. This means PREWRITE is likely not used.
